### 1. Core Terminology

* **Layout & Composition:** The arrangement of text, images, and white space to create a harmonious and artistic design.

* **Alignment & Balance:** Placing elements in relation to each other to create equilibrium and organization.

* **Scale & Hierarchy:** Using size to establish an order of importance, ensuring the most critical info is seen first.

* **Contrast:** Distinct differences in color or size to improve readability and focus.

* **White Space (Negative Space):** The empty areas surrounding elements that prevent clutter.

* **Vector-Based Design:** Graphics created via mathematical formulas (like SVGs) that remain sharp at any scale.

### 2. UI vs. UX

| Feature | UI (User Interface) | UX (User Experience) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Visual and interactive elements. | How a user *feels* and interacts. |
| **Elements** | Icons, buttons, menus, and links. | Intuition, efficiency, and accessibility. |
| **Goal** | Aesthetic and functional beauty. | Ease of use and satisfaction. |

### 3. User-Centered Research & Testing
* **User Research:** The systematic study of user needs, behaviors, and pain points.

* **User Testing:** Capturing data while users actually interface with the application.

* **A/B Testing:** Shipping a feature to a subset of users to compare performance via analytics.

* **Exit Interviews:** Surveys given upon account cancellation to understand and reduce "churn."

* **Progressive Enhancement:** Ensuring essential content works for everyone, regardless of browser/device sophistication.

### 4. Essential UI Design Patterns

**Navigation & Flow**
* **Breadcrumbs:** Placed at the top of the page to show the site hierarchy.

* **Progressive Disclosure:** Hiding complex or irrelevant content until the user actually needs it to reduce cognitive load.

* **Lazy (Deferred) Registration:** Allowing users to browse and see value before forcing them to sign up.

**Interactive Components**
* **Infinite Scroll:** Best paired with a "Load More" button to give users control and maintain footer accessibility.

* **Modal Dialogs:** Pop-ups that dim the background. Use the HTML `<dialog>` element for built-in accessibility.

* **Progress Indicators:** Used in forms to show users how far they are in a process and allow them to return to previous steps.

* **Card Components:** Should be simple, uncluttered, and use high-quality media.

### 5. Accessibility & Best Practices
* **Color Contrast:** Minimum ratio of **4.5:1** for normal text and **3:1** for large text (per WCAG).

* **Dark Mode:** Use **desaturated colors** to reduce eye strain and intensity.

* **Responsive Images:** Ensuring images scale properly across all device sizes.

* **Shopping Cart:** Must always be visible (top-right), use familiar icons, and have a prominent "Checkout" CTA.

| Tool | Platform | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Sketch** | macOS | Simplicity, icons, and quick prototyping. |
| **Adobe XD** | Win/macOS | Integration with Photoshop/Illustrator and complex animations. |
