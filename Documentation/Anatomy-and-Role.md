# 🏗️ The Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule

To transform an element, you must write a Rule Set. Every rule follows a specific syntax:

<pre>
selector {
  property: value;
} 
</pre>

----


**Selector:** Points to the HTML element you want to style `(e.g., h1, p, or .class-name).`

**Declaration Block:** Everything inside the curly braces `{}.`

**Property:** The specific attribute you want to change `(e.g., background-color).`

**Value:** The setting applied to that property `(e.g., blue).`
