# 🌍 Browser Defaults, Resets, and the Viewport

When you build a website, you aren't starting with a truly blank canvas. Every browser has its own "hidden" CSS that it applies to your HTML automatically. Mastering these three concepts ensures your design looks the same for every user.

### ** 1. User Agent Stylesheets (Browser Defaults):**
A **User Agent Stylesheet** is the default CSS used by browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox to display web pages before any custom CSS is applied.

* ** The Problem:** Each browser has slightly different defaults. For example, one browser might add `8px` of margin to the `body`, while another adds `10px`.

* ** Visual Result:** This is why a heading `(<h1>)` might look larger or have more spacing in Chrome than it does in Safari.
