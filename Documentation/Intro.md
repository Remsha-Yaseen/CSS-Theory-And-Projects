🧠 Introduction to CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style the visual presentation of a web page. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, clothing, and makeup.

🏗️ The CSS Anatomy
Every CSS rule consists of a Selector and a Declaration Block.

Selector: Points to the HTML element you want to style (e.g., h1, .class, #id).

Property: The aspect you want to change (e.g., color, font-size).

Value: The specific setting you want to apply (e.g., red, 20px).
