# **🎨 CSS Mastery: Style, Layout & Architecture 🚀**
____

Welcome to my CSS learning repository! While HTML provides the skeleton, this space is dedicated to the "skin and muscles" of web development. This repo documents my journey from basic styling to advanced responsive layouts using freeCodeCamp standards.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to bridge the gap between raw HTML structure and professional UI design. It tracks my progress in mastering the Cascade, the Box Model, and Modern Layouts (Flexbox & Grid).

## 📂 Structure

* **Theory & Docs:** Deep dives into CSS rules, selectors, and the logic behind styling.

* **Projects:** Interactive UI components and full-page layouts (Cafe Menus, Forms, Galleries).

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

* **The Box Model:** Detailed notes on padding, margin, border, and box-sizing.

* **Typography & Colors:** Implementing Google Fonts, variables, and color theory (Hex, RGB, HSL).

* **Layout Engines:** Masterclasses in Flexbox for 1D alignment and CSS Grid for 2D structures.

* **Responsive Design:** Using Media Queries and relative units (rem, vh, vw) to build for mobile-first.

### 🚀 How to Use This

**Start with Theory:** Look into the Theory/ folder to understand why CSS behaves the way it does (Specificity & Inheritance).

**Explore Projects:** Navigate to the Projects/ folder to see how these theories transform boring HTML into beautiful interfaces.
